        <p class="card-text">
          My partner Brian and I live in Portland, Oregon with our two cats,
          Tango and Deedee. Together we enjoy exploring the local music and arts
          scene, taking evening walks in the neighborhood park, and spending
          time with our small community of friends. At home, I am often cuddled
          with the cats while reading a novel and sipping on a latte, my
          favorite pastime.

        <h2 class="card-title">Behavior Analyst</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          By trade, I am a Behavior Analyst. I have been working in the field
          for nine years. While I have thoroughly enjoyed helping others achieve
          their goals through the powers of positive reinforcement, I am ready
          for a career shift and look forward to applying my knowledge and
          understanding of human behavior in a tech role.

        <h2 class="card-title">Adventure Seeker</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          My hobbies include backpacking, canoeing, mountaineering, and alpine
          skiing. I have always been fascinated by the formation and healing
          properties of geothermal waters, so in my spare time, you can also
          find me soaking in a hot spring (or researching new soaking
          locations). Physical activity is essential for my mental and physical
          well-being and no better way to stay active than by adventuring in the
          expansive Oregon wilderness.

        <h2 class="card-title">Cooking & Baking</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          I am also passionate about all things involving food. Although I love
          cooking my loved ones a hot home-cooked meal, my true love is baking.
          Pastries, pies, breadâ€¦ I find the sensory experience and the process
          of taking simple ingredients, combining them, and creating something
          extraordinary to be incredibly satisfying.
